# Changelog

All notable changes to agentBrain are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [v1.6.2] - 2026-07-07

Consolidates the 1.6.2 prerelease line (01-07, entries below) plus a final
round. Highlights of the line: per-write space context inference replacing the
leaky vault-global active-space marker, an agent-agnostic note-id commit gate,
the `/skills` lifecycle orchestrator, nvm-aware agent-CLI installs on Linux
hosts, and preferences surfaced in the agent consult instruction.

Final round on top of prerelease-07:

### Added

- **`/namecheck` skill** (`system/skills/namecheck/`): sweep a product name
  across npm (package + scope), GitHub user/org (+ defensive variants), Open
  VSX, VS Code Marketplace, Homebrew, common TLDs, X and Reddit — and for every
  TAKEN resource report what's actually behind it (description, owner, site
  title) so conflict risk can be judged, not just availability. Ships with its
  own VERSION/CHANGELOG and a conflict-judgment rubric.
- **War-game mission template** (`system/templates/war-game-mission-template.md`):
  reusable blueprint for wargaming a mission on paper (moves, forks, abort
  conditions) before feeding it to a cheaper executor model.

### Fixed

- **Hermes integration completes on bun-less hosts.** The `agentbrain-mcp`
  server dropped its only Bun-specific API (`Glob` → node's recursive
  `readdir`), so one code path now runs identically under bun and node/tsx
  (verified on both; 42 addon tests green). `setup-hermes.sh` keeps printing
  the MCP wiring hint until `agentbrain` actually appears in Hermes'
  `config.yaml` — previously the hint appeared only on first install, so a
  host with the SOUL.md pointer but no MCP entry was never nudged again — and
  the hint is runtime-detected (bun, else `npm install` + `npx tsx`).
  `system/agent-config/hermes.md` documents the node fallback and the known
  not-yet-integrated Hermes surfaces (memory providers, hooks).

### Changed

- **Repo-root hygiene**: `.gitignore` now allowlists the repo root and blocks
  force-added ignored paths.
- **Addon client matrix**: `agentbrain-mcp` declares `hermes: rules` support.

## [v1.6.2-prerelease-07] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- **Preferences now surfaced in the agent consult instruction.** The
  `agentbrain` Pi extension's session-start system prompt now tells the agent to
  consult `local/preferences/personal/` alongside the core memory files at the
  start of meaningful coding work, including a pointer to each preference's
  `Wanneer` section. Previously preferences were discoverable but not
  signposted, so agents only found them when already looking. This is the
  knowledge-level lever (no hook, no fork) that lets a preference such as the
  new `ponytail-coding-default` (default ponytail discipline on coding tasks,
  lift-off for greenfield build intent) be reliably noticed and applied with
  judgment rather than mechanically injected.

## [v1.6.2-prerelease-06] - 2026-07-05

### Changed

- **Layer-B "ask" policy for uncertain space context.** When path signals cannot
  resolve a space but the conversation is about a specific owner/client, agents now
  ASK which owner-space a note belongs to (enumerated at runtime from `local/spaces/*/`)
  instead of silently defaulting owner-work into the personal vault. Documented
  canonically in `system/rules.md` (Spaces / ownership), with pointers from the
  `save-learning` and `project-update` skills. The policy is owner-agnostic — no client
  names appear in any public file (`check-space-boundary` enforces this); the concrete
  spaces live only in the gitignored `local/spaces/<slug>/` passports.

## [v1.6.2-prerelease-05] - 2026-07-05

### Changed

- **Space recall migrated off the vault-global marker.** MCP recall
  (`agentbrain-mcp` `search.ts` `activeSpace()`) now resolves the active space from
  the per-session env only (`AGENTBRAIN_CONTEXT`, with `AGENTBRAIN_SPACE` as a
  back-compat alias) — the same signal the write side infers. The
  `local/.active-space` marker is read by nothing anymore, completing the
  decommission of the leaky vault-global state that could cross parallel sessions.
- **`active-space.sh` fully deprecated.** `use` / `show` / `clear` still round-trip
  for backward-compat, but a warning makes clear the marker has NO effect on writes
  or recall; set `AGENTBRAIN_CONTEXT=<slug>` for the session instead.

### Added

- **The space reverse-map auto-regenerates.** `infer_context()` rebuilds
  `local/.space-map.json` when it is missing or older than a space passport, so
  code-root routing stays correct without a manual `build-space-map.sh` run
  (best-effort; a partial checkout without the generator just skips it). The
  repo-root resolver is captured at source time so it survives an empty
  `BASH_SOURCE[0]` when called from a bare command line.

## [v1.6.2-prerelease-04] - 2026-07-05

### Added

- **Per-write space context inference** (`system/lib/context.sh` `infer_context()`
  + `scripts/build-space-map.sh`). `new-note.sh` now decides which space a note
  belongs to per-write, from PATH-based and explicit signals only — the CWD's
  code-root, `AGENTBRAIN_CONTEXT`, the git remote — never content (a shared
  tech-stack would false-positive). A note written from a client's repo
  auto-routes to that client's space; personal/framework work lands in the shared
  vault. `build-space-map.sh` generates the reverse-map (`local/.space-map.json`,
  gitignored, holds absolute paths) from the space passports. Covered by
  `scripts/test-context.sh` (10 cases, one per breakage scenario) registered in
  doctor.

### Changed

- **`new-note.sh` context routing replaces the global active-space marker**, which
  married work-context to storage and leaked across parallel sessions. Outcomes: a
  confident slug writes into that space, `ambiguous` refuses, and `unknown` falls
  back to the main vault — or refuses under `--strict` /
  `AGENTBRAIN_STRICT_CONTEXT=1`. Adds a `--context <slug>` alias of `--space`, and
  degrades gracefully to the main vault when `system/lib/context.sh` is absent.
- **`active-space.sh` write-role deprecated.** The `.active-space` marker no longer
  routes note WRITES (those infer context per-write); `use` warns and the marker
  survives only to scope MCP recall. `save-learning` documents the new routing, and
  `test-active-space.sh` now guards that the marker does not route writes.

## [v1.6.2-prerelease-03] - 2026-07-05

### Added

- **Agent-agnostic note-id commit gate** (`scripts/validate-staged-note-ids.sh`
  + `scripts/hooks/vault-pre-commit.sh`, installed into the vault repo's
  `.git/hooks/pre-commit` and self-healed on every `sync-agentbrain-local.sh`
  run). A note whose `id:` doesn't match `uuid5-gen.sh` for its path can no
  longer be committed — no matter which agent or tool wrote it, including a Bash
  heredoc that bypasses the per-agent Write/Edit hooks. This is the one
  enforcement layer that is both agent- and tool-agnostic; the per-agent hooks
  become fast feedback rather than the source of truth.

### Fixed

- **Pi's note-id validator now BLOCKS a bad id pre-write instead of only warning
  after the fact.** It previously fired on `tool_result` and merely logged to
  stderr, so a note written under Pi could land with a mismatched (or
  hand-fabricated) id that the Claude Code PostToolUse hook (exit 2) would later
  reject — an enforcement asymmetry that let one agent build what another rejects
  by design. `note-id-validator.ts` now also runs on `tool_call` and returns
  `{ block: true }` for a Write carrying a mismatched id (mirroring
  `incognito-guard` / `git-interceptor`), with the `tool_result` advisory kept as
  a net for Edit/MultiEdit.
- **`new-note.sh` no longer mints a wrong id for a project note passed as a
  directory.** Project notes live at `<dir>/index.md`; passing the dir path
  hashed the directory instead of `.../index`, yielding a valid-but-wrong UUID5.
  It now appends `/index` (with a transparent notice) so the computed id matches
  the real file path.
- **`new-note.sh` now scaffolds project notes with a default `status: active`.**
  A freshly scaffolded project previously landed without a `status:` field, which
  `check-project-status-enum` rejects — so the note failed doctor (and could block
  the pre-push gate) until a status was added by hand. Same scaffold-produces-an-
  invalid-note class as the `/index` fix above.

### Changed

- **`scripts/validate-note-id.sh` gained a `--content-file` mode** so a note's id
  can be validated before the file is written (its target dir need not exist
  yet); this backs the Pi pre-write block with zero formula drift. Covered by 3
  new cases in `scripts/test-validate-note-id.sh` (13 total).

## [v1.6.2-prerelease-02] - 2026-07-04

### Added

- **`/skills` — local skill-lifecycle orchestrator** (`system/skills/skills/`). A
  thin router over existing tooling: `list` / `sources` / `audit` / `sync`, plus an
  `add-repo` flow that delegates discovery to skill-finder, scaffolding to
  addon-create, and enable/disable to `addons.sh`. Anchors on the `~/agentBrain`
  alias so it resolves the brain root through the `local/` vault symlink. Promoted
  from `local/skills/` after end-to-end testing.

### Changed

- **`skills audit` is now a layered audit**, folding in the skill-auditor
  methodology: it checks SKILL.md instructions for prompt-injection and
  `allowed-tools` for permission wildcards — not just code — and uses precise code
  patterns that no longer false-positive on plain function expressions or a
  regex's `.exec` method call.

## [v1.6.2-prerelease-01] - 2026-07-04

### Fixed

- **Agent-CLI installer now honors the nvm-managed Node contract.**
  `install-agent-clis.sh` sourced no nvm and ran `npm install -g` against
  whatever `npm` was on PATH, so on a non-nvm host (system/apt Node on Linux
  or a Raspberry Pi) global installs targeted a root-only prefix
  (`/usr/lib/node_modules`) and died with EACCES — and the "run manually" hint
  just reproduced the failure. The installer now loads nvm before agent
  detection and the install loop, and guards each `npm install -g` against a
  non-writable global prefix, skipping with an actionable "use nvm-managed
  Node, never sudo" message instead of a wall of EACCES.

## [v1.6.1] - 2026-07-03

Consolidates the 1.6.1 prerelease line (01-05, entries below) plus the final
hardening round. Highlights:

### Added

- **Spaces — sealed per-owner compartments** at `local/spaces/<slug>/` for
  employer/client knowledge: excluded from personal sync and default recall,
  written via `new-note.sh --space`, viewed via `list-* --space`, delivered as
  `space-id`-stamped packages (`brain-extract --space` / `brain-restore`), with
  per-space sync remotes, an active-space marker, and a boundary guard in doctor
  that fails the build on seal breaches or confidential leaks — including in
  non-git checkouts (fail-open closed).
- **New drift guards in doctor** (52 checks): skills-index parity
  (`system/skills/` ↔ `system/skills.md`), YAML well-formedness of all
  frontmatter blocks, reverse top-level inventory in `check-architecture.sh`,
  and pointer/reading-list sync.
- Unit tests for the security-relevant Pi extensions (git-interceptor,
  incognito-guard) and addon-CLI regressions — 164 addon tests, 26 extension tests.

### Changed

- **Docs truth sweep**: `architecture.md` documents the dual-checkout/alias/vault
  symlink model and the `shared/` layer; the skills index is complete (39);
  `reference.md`/`tools.md`/README corrected; one canonical session-start
  reading list. `youtube-knowledge` renamed to `youtube-digest` end-to-end
  (add-on, CLI, public folder — backward-compatible with auto-migration).
- Pi extensions compile under **strict TypeScript** and follow the
  **pi-ai 0.80 compat entrypoint** for `complete()`.
- Release channel defaults to **tag mode**; `codex` added to the canonical
  addon client list; `/onboard` vault-anchored with essential addons first.

### Fixed

- **uninstall.sh data safety**: block-based pointer removal (user content
  survives), `AGENTBRAIN_HOME` honored everywhere, multi-checkout alias guard,
  verified JSON edits, a "Left in place" summary.
- **Setup connectors**: OpenCode `instructions` array, Cline's own rules file,
  Windsurf root detection, exit-2 tool detection; bun/uv installers pinned;
  `configure-pi.sh` asks before installing.
- **Update flow**: repo resolution via the `~/agentBrain` alias; one documented
  `auto_update` cascade (missing file → `off`, missing key → `ask`).
- Thirteen skill bins resolve the brain root script-relative; stale pi-lens
  review selection; release tooling (publish zip path, changelog insertion
  order, maintainer tooling stripped from the payload); doctor `--ci` scopes
  `check-explainers` to the public themes.


## [v1.6.1-prerelease-05] - 2026-07-01

### Fixed

- `check-architecture.sh` failed doctor in every fresh install from a release
  archive: the backticked-path check flagged the dev/release tooling that
  `release.sh` intentionally strips from the payload (`deploy-dev-to-live.sh`,
  `release-check.sh`, …). The documented dev-only set is now tolerated when
  absent; the dev checkout still verifies it. Found by `release-check.sh` —
  the v1.6.1-prerelease-04 archive is superseded by this build.

## [v1.6.1-prerelease-04] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- **Skills-index parity check.** New `scripts/check-skills-index.sh` enforces two-way
  parity between `system/skills/` and the `system/skills.md` index (which had silently
  dropped ~18 of 39 skills); wired into doctor (52 checks).
- Unit tests for the security-relevant Pi extensions: git-interceptor's `--no-verify`
  blocking and incognito-guard's write-guard decision logic (14 cases), plus an
  addons-CLI regression test for `disable` on unknown ids (164 addon tests total).
- `test-space-boundary.sh` provisions a throwaway git-inited vault when `local/` is not
  a git repo, so sandboxes and fresh installs exercise the seal-breach scenario.

### Changed

- **Docs truth sweep.** `architecture.md` now documents the dual-checkout/alias/vault-symlink
  model and the `shared/` knowledge layer, and its stale claims are corrected; one canonical
  session-start reading list (the installed pointer), guarded by `check-rules-pointer-sync.sh`;
  `reference.md`/`tools.md`/README refreshed; `check-architecture.sh` gained a reverse
  top-level inventory check and now also path-checks README and reference.md.
- `youtube-knowledge/` renamed to `youtube-digest/`; README addon table regenerated from
  `system/addons/` (ghost entry dropped); devbox pilot plan moved to the private vault.
- Pi extensions compile under strict TypeScript (`strict: true`); the legacy `as any`
  casts on the Pi event boundary use the typed overloads.
- `codex` added to the canonical addon client list; `clients.md` regenerated.
- `/onboard` anchors every command at the vault, promotes the essential addons first,
  derives locale choices from `_strings.sh`, and documents the `auto_update` cascade.

### Fixed

- **uninstall.sh data safety:** pointer-block removal is block-based (user content after
  the block survives, timestamped backups kept); shell-rc cleanup honors `AGENTBRAIN_HOME`
  (a sandboxed uninstall edited the real `~/.zshrc`); the `~/agentBrain` alias and `brain`
  symlink are only removed when they resolve to the checkout being uninstalled; python JSON
  edits are verified; a "Left in place" summary lists what uninstall keeps.
- **Setup connectors:** OpenCode writes the `instructions` array in
  `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` (the old `system_prompt` key was never read); Cline
  gets its own `Rules/agentBrain.md` instead of overwriting `.clinerules`; Windsurf writes
  into the detected root; Claude/Gemini connectors exit 2 when the tool is absent.
- **Update flow:** default repo resolves via `readlink` of the `~/agentBrain` alias; one
  `auto_update` cascade (file missing → `off`, key missing → `ask`, seed `ask`).
- **check-space-boundary.sh fail-open:** `git grep` in a non-git checkout (release payload,
  install sandbox) errored silently and passed the leak scan; plain-grep fallback added.
- **check-pi-lens.sh** selects the latest review by filename timestamp instead of mtime
  (equalized mtimes kept reporting four already-resolved issues as open).
- Thirteen skill bins resolve the brain root script-relative instead of hardcoding
  `~/agentBrain` (fixes `test-list-space` in the validate-install sandbox).
- Release tooling: `publish-gitea-release.sh` zip path aligned with `release.sh` output;
  `bump-version.sh` inserts new sections below `[Unreleased]`; mktemp scratch files.
- bun/uv installers pinned; `configure-pi.sh` asks before installing Pi/opensrc.


## [v1.6.1-prerelease-03] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- **Spaces — sealed per-owner compartments (Phase 1).** A new first-class layer at
  `local/spaces/<slug>/` for employer/client knowledge: kept out of the personal sync
  (gitignored) and excluded from default recall (`brain_search`/`brain_recent`). Each
  space carries an `index.md` paspoort (`type: space`, a stable `space-id`, plus `owner`,
  `relation`, `sync`, `code-roots`). Write into a space with `new-note.sh --space <slug>`
  (slug path-escape-guarded, path-correct UUID5); view a space with `list-learnings` /
  `list-projects --space <slug>`; deliver a whole space as a portable, `space-id`-stamped
  package with `brain-extract --space <slug>` and re-import with `brain-restore` (confined
  to `local/spaces/<slug>/`, with path-traversal refused). Per-space backup remotes, a
  leakage boundary-guard, and an active-space mode are planned (Phase 2-3).

## [v1.6.1-prerelease-02] - 2026-06-26

### Changed

- **Renamed the `youtube-knowledge` add-on to `youtube-digest`** (CLI `yt-knowledge` →
  `yt-digest`, data dir `local/youtube-knowledge/` → `local/youtube-digest/`, config dir
  `local/addons/youtube-knowledge/` → `local/addons/youtube-digest/`). The name now reflects
  what the add-on does — condense long videos into summarized, searchable notes — instead of
  the generic "knowledge".
  - **Backward-compatible.** The old CLI/skill names still work: `yt-knowledge` is a symlink
    to `yt-digest`, and `/yt-knowledge` remains as a deprecated skill alias.
  - **Auto-migration.** On first run the `yt-digest` CLI renames a consumer's existing
    per-machine `youtube-knowledge` config/state/data dirs to the new slug and repairs the
    absolute filepaths in `state.json`/`learnings-index.json`. Idempotent; a no-op on brains
    that never used the add-on or are already migrated. No manual action required.

## [v1.6.1-prerelease-01] - 2026-06-24

### Fixed

- Default the release channel to **tag mode** (was branch mode): the public repo is a
  single-branch clean snapshot, so the `stable` channel now resolves to the latest
  `vX.Y.Z` tag instead of a non-existent `stable` branch.
- `publish-agentbrain-github.sh` refuses to publish a prerelease VERSION — the public
  GitHub mirror ships stable snapshots only; prereleases stay on the Gitea dev remote.

## [v1.6.0] - 2026-06-24

First stable release of the 1.6.0 line and agentBrain's public launch. Consolidates
the `1.6.0-prerelease-01..06` cycle; per-change detail is in the prerelease sections
below. Highlights:

### Added

- **Add-on-provided skills across every agent.** An add-on that ships a `SKILL.md`
  becomes a usable skill in each detected agent (Claude Code, Copilot CLI, Pi) while it
  is enabled — `addons.sh enable/disable/uninstall` are the lever — and `doctor` enforces
  the invariant (`check-skill-links.sh`).
- **`shared/` knowledge layer** — a third, shareable layer alongside private `local/`,
  with a bidirectional secret-gate, abort-on-conflict rebase, and an id-regenerating
  promote (`setup-shared-vault.sh`, `sync-agentbrain-shared.sh`, `promote-to-shared.sh`).
- **Platform-aware setup** (`scripts/platform.sh`: os/arch/id detection + capability
  probes) and an add-on **`onboard:`** lifecycle hook.
- **`incognito` add-on** (read-only, write-suppressing sessions) and symmetric
  `uninstall.sh` for the bundled add-ons.
- Public-launch hardening: `SECURITY.md`, a rewritten welcoming README, and the
  Apache-2.0 license.

### Changed

- `addons.sh update` re-runs the new version's install step and restores enabled state.
- Addon-skill linking unified in `scripts/lib/skills.sh` — the Claude/Copilot and Pi
  installers share one implementation.

### Fixed

- Add-on lifecycle + portability: `uninstall` prunes skill links; `test` validates local
  add-ons; launchd resolves via dual-root and warns on dropped cron constraints; portable
  sha256; a SIGPIPE-guarded version probe; and a serialized pre-push `doctor` gate.

### Security

- `publish-addon.sh` keeps `GITEA_TOKEN` out of the process list (curl `--config`), and
  `release.sh` ships a tracked-files allowlist with a leak gate.

## [v1.6.0-prerelease-06] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- **Add-on-provided skills across every agent.** An add-on that ships a `SKILL.md`
  now becomes a usable skill in each detected agent (Claude Code, Copilot CLI, Pi)
  exactly while it is enabled — `addons.sh enable/disable/uninstall` are the lever.
  Linking is enabled-gated and enforced by `check-skill-links.sh` in `doctor`
  (enabled ⇒ linked, disabled ⇒ no orphan). Previously an add-on's skill was never
  installed for any agent unless wired by hand.
- `shared/` knowledge layer — a third, shareable layer alongside private `local/`, backed
  by its own git repo. `setup-shared-vault.sh` establishes it with a tiered, host-agnostic
  remote flow (BYO `--remote` / `--bootstrap` a local bare repo); it does not install a git
  server. `sync-agentbrain-shared.sh` syncs with a **bidirectional secret-gate**
  (`check-agentbrain-shared.sh`, pre-push tree scan + `--incoming` scan of fetched refs) and
  rebases with abort-on-conflict (never force). `promote-to-shared.sh` moves a note or folder
  from `local/` to `shared/`, regenerating its path-derived UUID5 and logging a reversible
  old→new id map. `doctor` runs the shared gate when a `shared/` layer is configured and skips
  it cleanly otherwise. Docs: `docs/shared-vault.md`. Design + plan in `local/specs/`.
- `SECURITY.md` (private reporting via GitHub Security Advisories + a "what agentBrain
  touches" section) and README "this is / this is not" + "What it writes & network
  behavior" sections, toward a credible public launch.

### Changed

- `addons.sh update` now re-runs the new version's install step and restores enabled
  state after download (previously the files were updated but install hooks and skill
  links were left pointing at the old version).
- Addon-skill link/prune logic extracted to a shared `scripts/lib/skills.sh`, sourced by
  both the Claude/Copilot installer (`setup-skills.sh`) and the Pi installer
  (`configure-pi.sh`) so the two can't diverge.

### Fixed

- `addons.sh uninstall` now prunes the add-on's skill links (true inverse of install/enable).
- `addons.sh test` validates local/downloaded add-ons against their own registry root,
  instead of silently passing them as "valid".
- `setup-addon-launchd.sh` resolves the addon dir via dual-root, so a registry-installed
  scheduled add-on can get a launchd job; it also warns when a `*/N` cron drops calendar
  constraints (e.g. a weekday restriction) instead of silently altering the schedule.
- `setup.sh`: guard `pi --version | head` against SIGPIPE under `pipefail`.
- Portable sha256 (`shasum` or `sha256sum`) in `addons.sh` and `package-addon.sh`.
- onboard skill: idempotent, backed-up shell-rc write and first-run-safe `config.json` edit.
- Hygiene: `addons.sh configure` validates numeric menu input; the English "newest" marker
  replaces a hardcoded Dutch string; `onboard:`-hook guards a missing `platform.sh`.
- `pre-push` hook serializes the `doctor` gate with a portable lock, ending the
  auto-push / manual-push race that produced spurious "push FAILED".

### Security

- `publish-addon.sh` passes `GITEA_TOKEN` via a mode-600 curl `--config` file instead of
  `-H "Authorization: …"` on the command line, keeping it out of the process list.

## [v1.6.0-prerelease-05] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- `brain version` (bare subcommand) as an alias for `brain -v` / `brain --version`.
  The flag forms already worked; the bare word fell into the unknown-command
  branch. Listed in `brain --help` COMMANDS and `system/tools.md`. (To check for a
  newer release on your channel, `brain-update.sh --check` already reports it.)

### Changed

- License changed from MIT to **Apache-2.0** ahead of the public release.
  See `LICENSE`.
- Rebrand legacy org references in the public layer to `frontmatters` (CHANGELOG
  release links, the `publish-*` / `check-release-published` scripts' `GITEA_OWNER`
  default, and the addon-registry URLs in `specs/`).
- Genericize a hardcoded machine-name example to `a home-server` in the event-bus
  storage SPEC.
- Slim the hot `system/rules.md`: move the path env-var (`AGENTBRAIN_DIR` /
  `AGENTBRAIN_HOME`) definitions and the forward-ref-marker detail to
  `system/reference.md` (progressive disclosure -- smaller always-loaded context).

### Fixed

- `peer-review --list` on an empty bus: `brain-poll` exits 1 as its "no events"
  signal, which under `set -o pipefail` aborted the whole read-only list. A
  zero-result list is valid, not an error -- the poll step now tolerates the
  empty-bus exit. (Surfaced as the `--list errored` skill-test failure.)

### Security

- `release.sh` built the archive from the whole working tree minus a denylist, so
  any stray in the checkout root (tool screenshots, machine-local agent config and
  override files, runtime logs) could ship in the public zip. The payload is now an
  allowlist driven by `git ls-files` (tracked files only, minus dev tooling and
  registry-distributed addons), with a redundant leak gate that aborts the build if
  any untracked file reaches the payload. Playwright-mcp page dumps are also
  gitignored. Build dropped from a stray-bloated 3.5M to ~0.8M.

## [v1.6.0-prerelease-04] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed

- `capture-tool-info`: route physical machines/hosts/devices to
  `local/devices/` instead of `local/integrations/`. The routing table had no
  destination for a host, so a Raspberry Pi was captured as a duplicate
  integration note. Adds a devices row, lists hosts/SBCs/NAS in the trigger
  section, extends the `type` enum with `device`, and documents the
  device-specific frontmatter (intent + state blocks).

## [v1.6.0-prerelease-03] - 2026-06-17

### Added

- `incognito` add-on: read-only brain sessions that suppress all writes
  (learnings, projects, troubleshoot, memories, journal). Enforcement reaches
  the MCP write point and Pi, with behavioural coverage for hook-less agents.
- `ask` `auto_update` mode in `brain-update` — when an update is available, it
  asks before applying (TTY y/N prompt, or an agent-neutral line in a hook
  session). This is the install default.
- Symmetric `uninstall.sh` (true inverse of `install:`) for `agent-browser`,
  `routa`, `sitescope`, `youtube-knowledge`, `secrets-helper`, and
  `agentbrain-mcp`. `check-addons` now fails any add-on shipping `install.sh`
  without a matching `uninstall.sh`.
- Event-bus garbage collection (`brain-events-gc`).
- Optional `platform` frontmatter field for notes.

### Fixed

- `event-bus`: doctor no longer hangs; added GC.
- `offboard`/`import-offboard`: closed scope and rollback gaps; added
  `--include-organization` (symmetric with `--include-team`).
- `setup-local-vault`: halts cleanly on a dangling `local/` symlink instead of
  failing cryptically later.
- `brain-update`: restores the branch on rollback and derives the release
  commitish from the branch.
- `peer-review` `test.sh` is sandboxed so it never writes to the live event-bus.
- `onboard` skill synced to the real update modes (`ask`/`notify`/`auto`/`off`);
  removed stale references to the retired `voice` add-on.

## [v1.6.0-prerelease-02] - 2026-06-14

### Added

- `secrets-helper` integration add-on: a thin, agent-agnostic installer for the
  macOS keychain `secrets-helper` (brew-first, public git-clone fallback,
  idempotent, macOS-guarded).
- `os` platform axis in the add-on manifest schema (`macos|linux|windows|any`,
  absent = cross-platform), validated by `check-addons.sh`, documented in the
  add-on README, and rendered as a column in the generated `clients.md` matrix.
- `unpark`: render a Markdown table of paused/blocked projects (newest first,
  numbered, full status) when called with no argument.
- Release advisory guard (`check-release-published.sh`): reminds at deploy time
  when a bumped VERSION has no published release.
- `still-needed` add-on + `/relevant` skill: per-item relevance check across
  parallel sessions ("is this open work already resolved elsewhere?").

### Changed

- `configure-pi.sh` now delegates `secrets-helper` installation to the add-on
  instead of a hardcoded block (closes the long-standing TODO; the legacy
  `SECRETS_HELPER_REPO` opt-in is preserved).
- `uxray` 0.1.1: added the "Absolute bans" auto-fail canon and AI-slop test;
  reframed as a self-contained, multi-platform methodology.

### Fixed

- `registry-index.sh`: keep only the highest-version zip per add-on id, so a
  stale older build can no longer win the index entry (avoids `ls`, SC2012-clean).
- `check-doctor.sh`: exempt advisory deploy-time checks (e.g.
  `check-release-published.sh`) from the orphan gate, so doctor stays green.
- `check-architecture.sh`: treat `local/*` paths as optional (user runtime
  state, absent in a fresh install) so doctor passes on a clean install.
- `test-addons.sh`: skip the maintainer-only publish-script regression guards
  when those scripts are excluded from an end-user install archive.

## [v1.6.0-prerelease-01] - 2026-06-13

### Added

- Addon registry (Docker/npm-style): static `index.json` registries with a
  per-machine **default** registry plus addable named registries
  (`addons.sh registry default|add|remove|list`). `search`/`install`/`update`
  resolve across them; installs verify `sha256`. Dupe rules: newest wins within
  a registry, the default registry beats named ones (dependency-confusion
  guard), explicit `<registry>/<id>` pin overrides.
- Dual-root addon discovery: bundled (`system/addons/`) + local
  (`local/addons/`); `status` gains VERSION/SOURCE columns, `--remote` adds an
  UPDATE column. `addons.sh new <id>` scaffolds an addon into `local/addons/`.
- Slim-core installer: `scripts/release.sh` ships only essential addons
  (`scripts/lib/essential-addons.txt`); the rest distribute via registries.
- Distribution tooling: `package-addon.sh` (privacy-scanned zip + sha256),
  `registry-index.sh` (generate index, validates URLs), `publish-addon.sh`
  (Gitea release + index), `mirror-registry-github.sh` (gated public mirror).
- `privacy-scan.sh --dir <path>` and `--git-identity <repo>` modes; offboard
  export/import now includes a `config/` section (registries, default-url,
  enabled addons, locale).

### Changed

- Renamed the primary-registry concept `official` → `default` (npm/cargo
  convention); index self-name `agentbrain-official` → `agentbrain`.
- The default registry is always resolved dynamically (env >
  `local/addons/default-url` > baked GitHub default); `registries.json` holds
  only named registries, so re-pointing the default never goes stale.

## [v1.5.6-prerelease] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- `scripts/install-prerequisites.sh` — general developer tools (nvm, Node LTS, Homebrew, bun, uv).
- `scripts/configure-pi.sh` — Pi-specific setup: install Pi, opensrc, extensions, skills, tsconfig, API check, credentials.
- `scripts/bootstrap-macos.sh` — slim macOS orchestrator; replaces `bootstrap-pi-macos.sh` as canonical entry point.
- `scripts/configure-clients.sh` — all AI client pointer installs extracted from `setup.sh`.
- `ensure_bun` and `ensure_uv` in `install-prerequisites.sh`.
- 6 skills added to `system/skills.md`: `capture-tool-info`, `refactor-brain`, `opensrc`, `lightpanda`, `understand`, `understand-project`.
- `opensrc` skill added to `.github/skills/` for Claude/Copilot/Gemini.
- `scripts/configure-clients.sh` added to lifecycle contract check.
- Gemini CLI pointer support in `setup.sh`, `uninstall.sh`, `move-agentbrain.sh`.
- Extended doctor to 15 checks: preference scopes, node bootstrap, lifecycle scripts, client pointers.
- Scoped preferences: `local/preferences/personal/`, optional `organization/` and `team/`.
- `/onboard` skill updated for personal-first scoped preference flow.

### Changed

- `bootstrap-pi-macos.sh` is now a thin backwards-compat redirect to `scripts/bootstrap-macos.sh`.
- `setup.sh` reduced from 484 to 269 lines by extracting client installs.
- `ensure_pi` moved from `install-prerequisites` to `configure-pi` (Pi is a client, not a dev tool).
- `scripts/readme-lightpanda.md` moved to `system/integrations/lightpanda.md`.
- All stale `bootstrap-pi-macos.sh` references updated across docs and scripts.
- README Quick Start updated: `./setup.sh` for everyone, `scripts/bootstrap-macos.sh` for macOS+Pi.
- `lightpanda-install-wrapper.sh` fixed: was hardcoded to `~/Developer/agentBrain/Scripts/`.

### Fixed

- `ensure_opensrc` regression: accidentally removed when extracting `ensure_pi`.
- Duplicate section numbering in `setup.sh` (two sections labelled "5").
- Stale comment "must match bootstrap-pi-macos.sh setup_local_structure".
- `docs/` empty directory removed.


### Added

- Reproducible Pi extension type-check and helper-test scripts integrated into doctor.
- Unit tests for brain path safety, session archive target selection, and YouTube VTT cleanup.
- `doctor.sh --pi-lens-strict` release-quality mode.

### Changed

- Hardened `brainPath(...)` to reject traversal outside the agentBrain root.
- Extracted YouTube transcript helper utilities and simplified markdown writer options.
- Hardened pi-cloak dynamic regex compilation with length and flag validation.

## [v1.5.1] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed

- Pi `brain-paths.ts` helper now exports a no-op default factory so Pi can auto-load the helper file without extension startup errors.
- Bootstrap now links helper modules required by Pi extensions, preventing missing `./brain-paths` imports in `~/.pi/agent/extensions/`.

## [v1.5] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- Doctor `--ci`, `--summary`, `--verbose` flags
- CI workflow calls `bash scripts/doctor.sh --ci` for full parity with local checks

- `.github/skills/doctor/` skill (SKILL.md + README.md)
- ShellCheck integration for all shell scripts
- Session continuity behavior rules in `system/agent-config/shared.md`
- Public docs at `system/sessions.md`

### Changed
