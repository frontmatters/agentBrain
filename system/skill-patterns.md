# Skill patterns

Conventions for building agentBrain skills. **Not** a style guide — these are
structural patterns that, when applied consistently, make skills predictable
for the user and easier to grow. Skip a pattern when it doesn't fit; cargo-cult
adoption is worse than ad-hoc design.

See also: `system/skills.md` (index), and — if installed — the `skill-creator`
skill (generic skill authoring, upstream from Anthropic).

## Focus-based skill

**Use when** a skill has 2+ independent scopes that a user can want to bend in
isolation — typically configuration, onboarding, or audit flows that touch
several unrelated concerns.

**Skip when** the skill has one scope, or its top-level structure is actions
(`show` / `save` / `delete`) rather than scopes. Filters on data (`--only=`)
are also not scopes — those stay flags.

### Surface

```
<skill>                  walk-all     — iterate every scope, skip-if-done
<skill> <focus>          walk-one     — just that scope (still skip-if-done)
<skill> --list           introspect   — print available scopes; no mutations
```

The user gets a single mental model: *"I can always run `<skill> <focus>` to
revisit one part without redoing the rest."*

### Contract

Every focus-based skill MUST satisfy three rules:

1. **Idempotent per scope** — re-running with the same focus is a no-op unless
   something in the underlying state actually changed.
2. **Detect before ask** — read the current state first; only prompt the user
   about what is missing or stale. Never ask questions the answer to which is
   already on disk.
3. **`<skill> <focus>` ≡ running it 10×** — identical observable behaviour
   regardless of repetition count. No counters, no drift.

### Anti-patterns

- Accepting `<focus>` but secretly running every scope anyway (defeats the
  contract — users can't trust the boundary).
- Using flags (`--only=<focus>`) instead of a positional focus arg for a
  scope-based skill. Flags read as filters, focus reads as "do this scope".
  Pick the one that matches the mental model.
- Mixing scopes and actions on the same level: `/skill action scope` is
  confusing. If you need both, the action is the subcommand and scope is its
  arg: `/skill <action> <scope>`.

### When to also implement `--list`

Mandatory when the user can plausibly forget which scopes exist (e.g. addons,
agent modules). Optional when scopes are intuitive and short (e.g.
personal/organization/team).

### Concrete examples

| Skill | Scopes | Why focus-based fits |
|---|---|---|
| `/onboard` | personal, organization, team, addons, locale | Each scope is an independent decision the user revisits separately. |
| `/config` | locale, addons, hooks, preferences, shell-rc | Same — read-/write-config concerns are orthogonal. |
| `/audit-feature` | a11y, security, performance, lint, tests | A frontend dev wants to spot-audit a11y today, performance tomorrow. |
| `/brain-review` | stale, duplicate, frontmatter, orphans | Vault maintenance has separable hygiene axes. |

### Counter-examples (do not apply this pattern)

| Skill | Why not |
|---|---|
| `/journal` | `show`/`save`/`archive` are actions, not scopes — use subcommand pattern. |
| `/selftest` | `--only=<agent>` is a filter on auto-detected modules; user doesn't choose scope, machine state does. |
| `/save-learning` | Single concern (capture a learning). No scopes to split. |
| `/doctor` | One holistic audit. Flags (`--ci`, `--summary`, `--with-selftest`) tune the run, no scopes to address one-by-one. |

## Subcommand-based skill (for comparison)

**Use when** a skill has multiple distinct **actions** on the same target —
read/write/delete-style.

```
<skill> <action> [args]      e.g. /journal show, /journal save "note"
<skill>                      defaults to the safest read-only action (show/status/list)
```

Examples: `/journal`, `/addons` (`status`/`install`/`enable`/`disable`).

**Don't combine** with focus-based — pick one top-level surface, not both. If
a skill genuinely needs both (rare), the action is the top level and scopes
become its args: `/audit-feature run a11y` rather than `/audit-feature a11y run`.

## Authoring checklist

When writing a new skill that fits the focus-based pattern:

- [ ] Frontmatter `argument-hint` lists scopes explicitly: `"[personal|organization|team|...]"`
- [ ] SKILL.md has a `## Scopes` section enumerating each scope + what it does
- [ ] SKILL.md has a `## Resumable behavior` section quoting this pattern's contract
- [ ] If scopes are non-obvious, support `<skill> --list`
- [ ] Each scope's logic is wrapped in its own section/function, so adding a new scope is local
- [ ] Slash-command wrapper in `~/.claude/commands/<name>.md` passes `$ARGUMENTS` through; the SKILL.md handles parsing
- [ ] Update `system/skills.md` skills-table row with a hint at the scopes

When writing a subcommand-based skill, the equivalent checklist lives in the
skill itself (see `/journal` for a worked example).
